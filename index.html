			<h1 class="center">About me</h1>
			<p>My name is Moritz also known as Fury. Born 1996 in Germany. I am a hobby musician, surveyor and streamer. On this site you will find my links to my social media and streaming platforms, collected works of interest in surveying and collected proof about a topic close to my heart which is possible lost civilizations during the ice age.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 class="center">Why Ice Age civilizations</h2>
			<p>The reason why I chose that topic is that archeologists believe that they mostly have the history of humanity and civilizations figured out. That believe can create a dogma and a paradigm around our history. But to my opinion there is an overwhelming amount of clues and sites that made me doubt it. Under the thread <a href="/Proof/Proof.html"> Proof of civilizations</a> you will find multiple sources and articles about that topic, archeological sites and what convinced me that there is more to our history than we currently believe.</p>

			<h3 class="center">Surveying</h3>
			<p>Surveying has been a fascination of mine for a long time. I have always been amazed by ancient maps and the art that went into surveying the areas and creates their respective maps. And since one of my hobbies also includes medieval fairs specifically represenation of the roman 1st century AD and 13th-15th century knights. For that I started researching the surveying methods throughout time and started collecting information about those methods. Also cartography and surveying has held an important part in some times throughout history. Under the thread of 
				<a href="Survey/Surveying.html">Surveying throughout time</a> you will find the used methods and examples of surveying and cartography.

			<h4 class="center">Social Media and more</h4>
			<p>In my free time I indulge in multiple different activities. Which are interwoven or sparked interest in the topic you will find explained here or the activities on my respective platforms. 
				<!-- Die Liste nicht nummeriert weil ich das visuelle in den Vordergrund gestellt habe (und ob da jetzt ul oder ol steht..) -->
				<ul>
					<li>Music</li>
					<li>Streaming</li>
					<li>Medieval Fairs</li>
					<li> Sports and more</li>
				</ul>
				I have been making music for over a decade. I play Piano, Guitar and have visited a music school for about 2 years for classic, jazz and improvisation. I have a handfull of songs that I composed available to listen too. I started streaming in December of 2020 and have been active on and off, playing Videogames or varying Genres, Podcasts about differing topics and more. Affiliate since January 2021. Medieval Fairs were something that I always enjoyed visiting but have been as an actor on said Fairs since 2011 as a knight (13th-15th century) and since a couple years as a roman (1st century AD) where I have continued to deepen my knowledge about history.
