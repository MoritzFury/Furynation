            <h1 class="center">The possibility of a lost civilization</h1>
            <p>The current model of history says, that what we define as civilization started to emerge about 6000 years ago but the possibility of an advanced lost civilization at the end of the last ice age (9.600 BC) and before is extremely likely. Said civilization will most likely have been wiped out by the events of the younger Dryas. Which according to the younger Dryas impact hypothesis came through cosmic impacts. 
			 <br> The last ice age or glacial maximum started about 115 thousand years ago and endet about 11.600 years ago in a global catastrophe. After said catastrophe the world looked very different the sea level rose about 400 feet (120 meters), the world experienced massive flooding and due to isostetic rebound the world changed it's face.
			 <br> We will start with evidence for structures and history that goes against modern archeology and the so far standing human history.

			<h2 class="center">Megalithic structures</h2>
			<p> There are megalithic structures that bring our understanding of our hunter gatherer ancestors into question. One of these structures is Gunung Padang in Indonesia. <br>

				<br> Gunung Padang was first discoverd in 1890 and archeologists were sure that nothing their would be older than 2500 years old. But Dr. Ali Akbar and his team found during his research found that the site consists of more than one cultural layer. The first layer is from 500BC but at 4 meters depth there was another one dating back to 5200BC. Furthermore the columnar jointing (the hexagonal stone slabs) that litter the site are supposed to be natural. 
				The formation of those blocks are indeed natural but not the position in which they have been found. In ringed walls surrounding the terraced slopes, horizontal and with 5cm consitent material in bewteen them. And those basalt blocks are actually not from that region but have been imported. Up to 50.000 of them, all of them between half a meter to a meter in length and weighing up to 300 Kilogramm.
				Another researcher, Dr. Danny Hilmann Natawidjaja found through GPR Survey (Ground Penetrating Radar), resistivity tomography and seismic tomography that there were even undergound Chambers and shafts right along the central axis and the site. And after the usage of another geological tool, core drilling he found something amazing.
				<br> The samples of the first two layers date back to 3000 years ago to around 8000 years ago. But at a depth of around 50 feet (15 meters) they found that those sextions were layed out around 11.600 years ago. Pushing it back to the end of the last ice age. At around 100 feet in layer 4, Dr. Hilmann hit the earliest layer of construction (dateble organic material associated with structural elements) which could date back to before 20.000 years ago.

			<h3 class="center">Göbekli Tepe</h3>
			<p>
				Göbekli Tepe is a site in Turkey, which was discoverd in 1994. There are right now 4 enclosures excavated and with up to 20 more waiting inside the hill.
				<br> <img src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/7vo5zr9QjdkHMnwu07dIU943KWdK1ANIjS14ukeM-mU/rt:fit/w:1200/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy80Yjlm/NDM3OS0xMTA0LTQ2/ZjktYjdlNi01ODRm/ZmMyNmNiYzkzODhk/ODI5MDllMWU3YTZm/OGJfR2_MiGJla2xp/dGVwZS5qcGVn.jpg" width="550" height="350" alt="Tepe1">

				<br> But they don't all date back to the same time. The oldest enclosure D dates back to around 11.600 years ago and the youngest, enclosure A to around 10.500 years ago. Which predates civilization, the invention of the wheel and the domestication of horses. Normally it is suspected that agricultuar came which resulted in surpluses and people being able to learn a certain craft. In this case though it appears around the same time or even slightly before. 
				There are many pillars in those enclosures weighing multiple tons and are very intricately craved with negative carvings. Meaning the stone was removed around the carving and sticks out of the pillar. And no one knows for sure how they were able to lift those stones. The most important one in my opinion is pillar 43, known as the vulture stone, in enclosure D. Dr. Sweatman believes that these symbols on the stone represent asterisms, figures meant to depict star clusters in the night sky. our Zodiac signs.
				From the assumption that the scorpion on the stone might represent our Scorpius, you can fit the other asterisms into the night sky. And under the notion of precession, the change of the position of the stars in the sky over time, you will find a certain window of time in our past where it would fit. And again we arrive at the date of 10.900 to 10.800 years ago. There is also another pillar of great improtance but I will talk about that later.
